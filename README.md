## 1. Description

In the script, you can find all the preprocessing steps and analysis I have done for writing the [blogpost](https://medium.com/@vadimvoskresensky/how-do-berlin-neighbourhoods-differ-on-airbnb-bbf2789e9a1d) on text analysis of AirBnB hosts' descriptions and guests' reviews of Berlin apartments. Such type of analysis can be useful for hosts to explore what tourists value in different locations and follow how their competitors advertise their apartments. The project is done in the framework of Data Scientist Nanodegree on Udacity.

## 2. Data

All data I use for analysis can be collected from here: http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html.

For such type of analysis, you need three files: listings.csv.gz (all information on the apartments), listings.csv (summary on listings with information on neighbourhoods), and reviews.csv (all the reviews for apartments).
